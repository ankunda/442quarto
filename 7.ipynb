Caesar used to replace A with D, B with E, C with F, …, X with an A, Y with a B, and Z with a C. Because the alphabet was rotated by 3 positions, this specific version can be called a rot-3 cipher.

A sliding shift cipher attempts to make this more difficult by employing a different shift for each position in the plain text string. For example, the first letter is encoded using rot-1, second letter using rot-2, third letter using rot-3, etc. One doesn’t have to start at 1, but the increase size is typically 1.

    "- Vigenere cipher: 1553-1863. Each letter of the plain text was encoded by rotating the alphabet based on a key or passphrase. For example, if the key was “key”, then the first letter would be gotten from a rot-10 alphabet i.e. where a became k, b became l, c became m, etc. The second letter would be gotten from a rot-4 alphabet i.e. where a became e, b became f, c became g, etc. The key would be repeated as many times as necessary to encode the entire plain text. A cipher disk or vigenere table (such as the one shown below) can be used for manual encryption/decryption.

    "##### **<ins>Encoding.</ins>**\n",
    "Cryptography is not only about hiding information. Sometimes its just about representing information in a manner that is convenient to work with. For example, since computers only deal with 1s and 0s, we have encoding schemes to represent information like characters in 1s and 0s. \\\n",
    "The most common encoding format is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) which is based on the English alphabet. Its original format only required 7 bits to represent any thing that might be represented i.e. numbers, lower case and upper case letters, punctuation, and control characters (which were non-printable). \\\n",
    "\n",
    "Later as 8 bit storage became the norm, ASCII was extended to 8 bits which allowed for double the encodings. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Common conversions are \\\n",
    "A = 65 = 01000001, B = 66 = 01000010, a = 97 = 01100001, b = 98 = 01100010 \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Another common encoding scheme is base-64. This particular scheme was birthed from a need to send any kind of binary information (such as attachments in en email) along a channel that only carried text. One way to identify this scheme is that the file will be made up entirely of characters, numbers and two signs e.g. + and /. Some files will also end with one or more = signs. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "The process of converting any binary stream to base-64 is similar to the conversion from binary to hexadecimal you covered in CSC/CYEN 131 i.e. group the bits, and then look up the mapping for that group (or the mapping for the numerical value of that group). It should not come as a surprise that for base 64, we shall be looking at groupings of 6 bits. $(2^6 = 64)$"

    "##### **<ins>Cryptography today*.</ins>**\n",
    "The Internet created a need for an even more secure cryptography. We now all use a system over which no single entity has complete power and bad actors can easily get access to the information you are sending to or receiving from someone else. Additionally we also need ways of confirming that the person we are communicating with is in fact the person we intended to communicate with, or the file we requested is in fact the file we received. All these issues/problems leverage modern cryptography in some form. \\\n",
    "Symmetric-key cryptography works like most of the classic cryptography approaches we discussed earlier i.e. both sender and receiver need to share the key in order to encrypt and decrypt the message. Depending on the algorithm, the input stream can be encrypted as it is experienced (stream ciphers) i.e. a byte or letter at a time OR it can encrypt them in blocks of bits with each block encrypted as a single unit (block ciphers). \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Examples of algorithms in this category include AES, 3DES, Serpent, Twofish, Blowfish \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "This is typically a fast cryptography approach. The only issue is that it is based on the assumption that the two people trying to communicate were able to share a key privately. Doing so requires a private channel and yet we’re trying to set up a private channel. Many times this is not possible for one reason or another e.g. physical separation. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "![](2.png)\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Asymmetric cryptography is relatively newer and uses the idea of two keys. The two keys are linked in such a way that any message encrypted with one of them requires the second to be decrypted. Another characteristic of the keys is that you can not design (or guess) one of them from the other. This second characteristic is the whole crux of the system. One of the more common ways of guaranteeing that is the use of prime numbers/factors. It takes very long to identify whether a number is prime, and it takes even longer to identify the prime factors of a number (particularly a very large number). The process of encryption/decryption is therefore slightly different. The person who wants to send a message encrypts it with one key, and the person who wants to decrypt it uses the other key. The first key is called the public key because you provide that key to everyone and anyone. You do this so that anyone who wants to send you a message can be sure that you are the only person who can open it since you are the only person who has the other key (aptly called the private key)\n",
    "![](3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major advantages of this approach. First is that we don’t have to have met for you to communicate with me and know that our communication is private. There are servers dedicated to storing people’s public keys, people attach them to emails, etc. So if you want to communicate with me, all I have to have done is have published my public key somewhere. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "The second advantage is that this technique allows us to solve the problem of confirming the identity of someone if the encryption/decryption process is reversed. Person A uses their private key to encrypt a broadcast message. Anyone who has access to their public key (which everyone does) can now use that key to decrypt the message. It might be weird because it is not a secret message and anyone can decrypt it but the cool thing about it is that we all know that no-one else could have created that message in the first place since only you have the private key. In that regard, the public/private key approach allows us to have digital signatures which help us to determine the authenticity of a message. It allows us to answer questions like “is this message from a trusted source?” and “has this message been changed in transit by someone pretending to be the trusted source?”. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Examples of the public/private key systems include Diffie-Helman, RSA, DSA (Digital Signature algorithm), ECDSA (Eliptical curve DSA). You can find some of these details in the certificate details of your web browser. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Hashing is another way cryptography is used today. Recall from CSC 220 that hashing is a central part of how hash tables work. For hash tables, hashing converted a key of any length/type into a valid index in the table where the value would be stored. Outside of hash tables, hashing is used to translate data of any size into a unique fixed size string output. Any good hashing function works in such a way that this process cannot be reversed. At first glance, this seems counter productive i.e. why scramble up a long message into a short string of gibberish if I cannot unscramble that gibberish back to get the message? The reason is that a good hash function will scramble any message into a unique string of gibberish. I’ll give you two examples of where this functionality is actually helpful. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Imagine you downloaded an ISO file for Linux Mint and it took 2 hours to download on your home internet (in fact imagine how long it would take on the slow internet we had not that long ago). It would be very painful if you took a full day installing the operating system only to realise that the ISO file was corrupted in some way during the download and you’ll have to start the whole download and install process again with the hope that it doesn’t happen again. What many servers that store large files will do is provide a hash of that file. That way once you have downloaded the file, you can run it through the hash function, a process which takes a very short time, and confirm if the hash you got is identical to the hash that the server said you should get. If so, then your file was not corrupted. If not, then you need to re-download and not waste your time installing the corrupted file. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Another place that hashing is used is in the storage of passwords. Given that bad actors can easily get access to systems, it would be bad if they got access to every password that was ever used on that system in plain text. What most servers/systems will do is actually store a hash of your password instead. That way there is no way the bad actors can get your passwords. They just get the hashes and there is no way to get the passwords when you have the hash. The only thing they can do is run a bunch of passwords they know of through the hashing function and hope that one of them hashes to the exact same thing as your hash. And if that happens then they have figured out your password. There are ways to deal with this but they are beyond our discussion right now. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "There are multiple hashing functions being used these days. These hash functions are typically evaluated based on the number of collisions they have (which should be very low), and how difficult they are to reverse (which should be impossible). \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "MD5 (Message Digest algorithm 5) converts large data into a string of 128 bits. As early as 1993 researchers found vulnerabilities in it (such as collisions) and so it isn’t used much for high security cryptography but rather for checksums to verify data."
