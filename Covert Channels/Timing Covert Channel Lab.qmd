In the last lecture, you covered different ways that someone might set
up and take advantage of a Covert Channel. In the last lab, you set up
one such Storage covert channel using the file permissions of an FTP
server.

In this lab, we shall set up a Timing Covert Channel. We will set up a
server that will transmit text overtly, but transmit a covert message
hidden in the timings between each successive character of the overt
message.

As an example, a delay of 0.025s between parts of the message could be
translated to a 0 while a delay of 0.1s can be translated as a 1.

In order to transfer a long covert message, we will need a much longer
overt message. Using the suggestion above, transmitting a single covert
character (7 or 8 bits) would require the transmission of 8 or 9
characters. As mentioned earlier, this isn't too unreasonable because
Covert channels are typically low bandwidth (i.e. can only realistically
send small messages).

To end the message we have a couple of options to consider. We could
just repeat the covert message over and over and trust the recipient to
know when they have received the entire message. However, this would
make our channel easy to notice and analyse. A more surreptitious option
would be to add a special tag at the end of our covert message to
signify that the hidden message has been received in its
entirety...perhaps the string "EOF"

# Setting up the server

Let's create a basic TCP server using python's socket library.

```python
import socket

# define a host and a port
HOST = "127.0.0.1"	# This is the ip address for a local host
PORT = 1337		# Choose a port number that is not typically
			# used by other traffic.

# Now to create a Socket object and connect it to the specific host and
# port identified by our constants above

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s. bind((HOST, PORT))
s.listen(0)	# the argument determines how many connection requests
		# will be added to the queue. 0 means that it will not 
		# add any new request to the queue and will reject any
		# incoming requests if it is already dealing with one.

print(f"Server is listening on {HOST}:{PORT}")

while True:
    # Note that if you wanted your server to be able to deal with more
    # than one client at a time, this portion would be threaded. For our
    # demonstration, you won't need to create a threaded server.
    
    c, addr = s.accept()	# store client details when connection
				# comes in. "c" is the client socket,
				# and "addr" is the client address.
    
    print(f"Connection from {addr} established")

    # the b in the sendall command below ensures that the message is
    # sent as bytes, which is the form that sendall requires.
    c.sendall(b"Hello from the other side. I must have called a thousand times")

    # make sure to close the connection
    c.close()
    
```

:::{.callout-tip}
If you haven't done any socket programming before, this is a good place
to stop and test your server. Its always fun to see how your code could
work over a network.

Later on in this lab, we'll design a programmatic client that will
connect to our server. But you don't need one for now. You can use in
built tools in the terminal that allow you to connect to a client/port.

1. Using **telnet**
```sh
telnet 127.0.0.1 1337	# general form is telnet server_ip server_port
```
Telnet is used for plain text communication and is unencrypted so don't
use it for sensitive data.

2. Using **netcat**
```sh
nc 127.0.0.1 1337
```
Hit `Ctrl + C` or type `exit` to exit. Netcat is used to test and debug
network services.

:::


The code above is a very simple server example. We need to tweak it to
send one character at a time with a delay between each character where
the delay is actually our covert channel.

In order to do this, we shall have to make a couple of changes to our
code above starting with importing the `sleep` command from the `time`
library.

```python
from time import sleep
```

To make our code easier to adjust, we should probably put some time
constants at the top of our code too.

```python
ZERO = 0.025	# How long to wait for a zero
ONE = 0.1	# How long to wait for a one
```

Our algorithm for sending the message is also going to change a little
bit. Instead of using `sendall`, we shall use `send` which allows us to
send smaller chunks of the message.

Our loop for sending the cover

and then create a socket object that we can then bind to a specific
port. That means that it will be listening to that port and will be
required to do something when a connection comes in on that port.

```python
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
port = 1337	# choose a port number that should typically be available

s.bind(("", port))

Depending on how far you went with a previous lab, you might not need to
do the `Setting up an FTP server` section at all.

## Installation

We shall be using vsftpd (Very Secure FTP Daemon). To do that run the
following commands in the terminal

```sh
sudo apt update		# to update your software listings
sudo apt install vsftpd	# to actually install vsftpd
```

Once the installation is done, you should be able to confirm that it is
installed and running correctly with the following command.

```sh
sudo netstat -alpn | grep ' LISTEN '
```

:::{.callout-tip}
if the ```netstat``` command above doesn't work, you might need to install it
using the command
```sh
sudo apt install net-tools
```
Once installed, re-run the *netstat | grep* command from earlier.
:::

The command above should produce a list of services that are running on
your Linux machine. One of the lines in that list should have vsftpd in
it. Below is a screenshot showing what the line above produces on my
system.

![The last line in this Screenshot shows vsftpd is installed and working on my system](1.png)

## Login

Now try logging in to your ftp server from the same computer/system.

```sh
ftp localhost
```

Running the command above should allow you to log in to your own system
using the username and password of your system.  Feel free to navigate
and see what you have access to.

Some commands that might be of help to you include:

```
ls
ls -lh
cd foldername
cd ..
Ctrl + D
```

## Tweaking the FTP server

We can make some few modifications to make it a better experience. These
modifications include adjusting the welcome message, and adjusting the
folder that an ftp user is automatically sent to.

```sh
sudo vim /etc/vsftpd.conf	# feel free to use another editor other than vim
```

When inside the config file, look for and adjust the following lines
accordingly.
```default
anonymous_enable=YES
local_enable=NO
ftpd_banner=My first and Best FTP server # feel free to adjust this
anon_root=***	# where *** is the path to an appropriate folder with
    # appropriate permissions. A suggestion is /home/ftp which you 
    # will need to create if it doesn't already exist.
```

## Restart the FTP server

Restart the server and log in again. This time, you don't need to use
your system's credentials to log in. You should be able to log in
**anonymously**. That means your username is *anonymous* and your
password is blank i.e. just hit `Enter`

```sh
sudo service vsftpd restart
ftp localhost
```

You can also try to ftp into your ftp server from another computer. All
you'll need is the ip address of the computer on which the ftp server is
located.

If you set up this server on a virtual machine and set up the network
correctly, then your virtual machine will have a different IP address
from your host computer and you can do this part from your host
computer.

```sh
ftp 138.47.something.something	# recall you are running this command on your
    # host computer but using the ip address of your virtual machine (or
    # whatever computer the server is on)
```

# Storage Covert Channel

We are now going to use the ftp server as a Storage covert channel. More
specifically, we shall use the permissions of the files on that server
as a way of hiding a message.

Note that the permissions are typically made up of 10 characters that
could either be a letter [drwxl] or a dash [-]. We could take the
presence of any letter to be a 1 and its absence to be a 0. This allows
us 10 bits of information for each file.

There are two ways we could use these 10 bits

## 7 bits
We could ignore the first three bits and only embed ASCII letters with
the latter 7 bits of each file's permissions.
```default
---xrwxrwx
```
The file permission above would be translated to 1111111.

Unfortunately, a list of files where the first 3 bits of file
permissions were consistently not being used would rouse too much
suspicion. So in order to make it look more convincing/surreptitious, we
could add random files as noise into the file list. These "noise" files
would have to have at least one of their first 3 bits set so that they
could be differentiated from the actual hidden message.

Here is an example of what we're trying to do.

Suppose we have the message `Demigod` that we want to embed.

First we break it down into its ASCII representation.
```
D = 68 = 1000100
e = 101 = 1100101
m = 109 = 1101101
i = 105 = 1101001
g = 103 = 1100111 
o = 111 = 1101111
d = 100 = 1100100
```

File permissions are made up of three categories of flags that determine
whether three user categories (user, group, other) can read, write, or
execute the associated file respectively.

If we are going to embed our message into these 9 bits, we will have to
change our message bits from 7 to 9 bits by prepending 2 bits to each
character's representation.

```
D = 001 000 100
e = 001 100 101
m = 001 101 101
i = 001 101 001
g = 001 100 111 
o = 001 101 111
d = 001 100 100
```

Conveniently, it is possible to quickly set the permissions of a file to
a 9 bit pattern. All one needs is the decimal equivalent of each 3 bit
grouping. This will end up with each 3 bit pattern being replaced with a
number in the range [0,7] i.e. the smallest 3 bit number - 000 to the
largest 3 bit number - 111.

```
D = 104
e = 145
m = 155
i = 151
g = 147
o = 157
d = 144
```

We shall now create a bunch of random files (with the `touch` command),
and adjust their permissions (with the `chmod` command) using the
numbers identified above.

```sh
touch file1
chmod 104 file1
touch file2
chmod 145 file2
touch file3
chmod 155 file3
touch file4
chmod 151 file4
touch file5
chmod 147 file5
touch file6
chmod 157 file6
touch file7
chmod 144 file7
```

This should produce something like this in your folder.

```default
---x---r-- 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file1*
---xr--r-x 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file2*
---xr-xr-x 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file3*
---xr-x--x 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file4*
---xr--rwx 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file5*
---xr-xrwx 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file6*
---xr--r-- 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file7*
```

Like we mentioned before, note that all the files that actually have
something in their permissions do not have any of the first 3 flags set.

We should now add some noise to the files, making sure that every file
that is termed as *noise* has at least one of the first 3 flags set.
This will make our file server contents look more believable.

```default
---x---r-- 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file1*
d--xrw-r-- 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file1.5*
---xr--r-x 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file2*
---xr-xr-x 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file3*
-r-xrwxrwx 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file3.5*
---xr-x--x 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file4*
---xr--rwx 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file5*
-rwx--xr-x 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file5.5*
---xr-xrwx 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file6*
-rw-r---wx 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file6.5*
---xr--r-- 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file7*
drwxr-xrw- 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file7.5*
```

SUCCESS. Covert channel has been set up and hidden message has been
embedded. 

How would we go about retrieving the message?

```
---x---r-- 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file1*
0001000100 = 68 = D
d--x---r-- 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file1.5*
1001000100 = ignored
---xr--r-x 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 16:15 file2*
0001100101 = 101 = e
...and so on...
```

## 10 bits

One criticism of the covert channel above is that we are wasting 30% of
the bits available to us. With just a small tweak to our algorithm, it
is possible to use all the 10 bits in the file permissions instead of just
7.

There are a few implications we need to know though chief of which is
that we can no longer afford to include noise files. This is because
there is no way to differentiate the noise files from the files that
have legitimate portions of the message embedded in their permissions.

To create the message, we'll need to 
1. order the files in the server alphabetically,
2. Create a complete message by appending all the bits of the hidden
   message together, and then splitting them into groups of 10. Each 10
   bit grouping will be applied to a single file.
3. If the message we are trying to embed isn't made up of a perfect
   multiple of 10bits, then we pad the message with extra 0's.
4. During the decoding process, we should collect all the bits into a
   single stream, split them into groups of 7s (since we are using basic
   ASCII), and then convert each group of 7 into its associated
   character, and then reassemble the message.

try to decode the following

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"} 
The first file
```default
d---r--rwx 2 prof prof 4K Mar 27 20:57 0fd1b45f22e18b3
```
decodes to `0101110010`

The second file
```default
-r-xrw--w- 1 prof prof 0 Mar 27 20:57 17c455d90e49
```
decodes to  `0101110010`

We keep on going till we get all the bits
```
100010011101011100100110010101011000100000111011111010001100

1000111100001111001001111110100001000000
```

We then group them into 7s and convert each group into its own ASCII
character.

```
1000100 1110101 1100100 1100101 0101100 0100000 1110111 1101000
